What is a "sexp"?

What is a "defun"?

write a macro, save it permanently, assign it a keystroke

delete line and close gap (as opposed to what C-a C-k does)

indent
  using tab and shift-tab
  setting tab stops for schedule, for entire buffer

save point on scroll, so that C-v then M-v returns to the same place

single key stroke for org-mode

auto-fill-mode - single keystroke, or automatically for all documents

move forward over word and whitespace to start of next word
      5       example

keystroke: go to last buffer (instead of C-x b RET)

integration with x clipboard

* Navigating

M-r  without moving text, move point to middle/top/bottom

M-g g goto-line, with numeric argument

* Narrowing
C-x n n    narrow-to-region
C-x n w    widen

* 11 The Mark and the Kill Ring

The region highlighting when you set the mark is transient mark mode

C-SPC        set-mark-command
C-x C-x      exchange-point-and-mark

C-SPC C-SPC  set mark but deactivate it
C-u C-SPC    return (this is set-mark-command with a prefix arg)

M-h        mark-paragraph
C-x C-p    mark-page
C-x h      mark-whole-buffer

M-@        mark-word. selects forward. repeat with M-@ C-x zzzz

C-M-@      mark-sexp. I still don't have a grasp of expressions

C-M-h      mark-defun
C-M-a      beginning-of-defun
C-M-e      end-of-defun

** Using region

C-x C-l    lower case
C-x C-u    upper case
C-u C-/    undo within region
M-%        replace text within region
C-x TAB    indent
M-x        fill-region
M-$        check spelling
M-x        eval-region
C-x r s    save to register

C-x C-SPC  pop-global-mark

* 12 Killing and Moving Text

** Cut and Paste

Help says EMACS uses clipbord by default with kill/yank. Mine does
not. Help said to set x-select-enable-clipboard, but I don't even have
that variable.

clipboard-kill-region didn't paste in another application, but
clipboard-yank did repaste the value in emacs.

x-select-enable-clipboard
x-select-enable-primary

** 12.4 Accumulating text

append-to-buffer
prepend-to-buffer
copy-to-buffer (overwrites)
insert-buffer (e.g. insert what you've been accumulation)
append-to-file

** 12.5 Rectangles
